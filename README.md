Buildr - Toolbox for creative players/servers
=============================================

Buildr is a collection of useful tools to make building/creating stuff easier and faster.
The key features of Buildr are the two buildmodes. 

The Globalbuildmode that offers Worldbased enhancements to building, while the Userbuildmode gives a single player some handy tools.
While the modes are disabled you can play minecraft without 

Most of the tools are nothing new and can most likely be found in other plugins and because of this you can disable every tool if you already use a plugin that offers this functionality in the detailed configuration file. 

Builder supports permissions and has a fallback to OP if no permission plugin was found.
